## Historical Analysis
Using Yahoo Finance, we can analyze the historical data of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to determine the number of 24-hour windows with at least a 5% price drop and the average drop window percentage. We can also determine the number of successful sell events, the average lot time, and the average profit percentage for each asset.

This data is not fully comprehensive as it only has price points once per day while Prometheus checks the price many times per day; however, this gives us a good approximation of the historical performance of this trading strategy.

Looking at `ETH` in 2019, we can see the following image
![ETH 2019](analysis/imgs/ETH_2019.png)
Each box represents a buy-sell combination. The colors and size of the boxes are random to be able to distinguish between them. Red lines indicate a BUY event. The width of the box represents the time from BUY to SELL. Buys only occur if the asset dropped at least 5% in the day delta. Sells only occur at the first opportunity to sell for at least a 12%
profit.

For this specific asset in 2019, we can see that the average drop window percentage is -8.52%, the average lot time is 21.29 days, and the average profit percentage is 14.67%.
